Project: Wood World
A small project by me that helpful for my dad's work and also to develop my skills in web development.
Project: Wood World
This project was developed as a personal initiative to support my father's local carpentry business. By leveraging HTML and CSS, I created a professional online portfolio to showcase his exceptional craftsmanship and handcrafted furniture. The website aims to expand his business's reach, attracting new clients and generating online offers. This digital platform provides a modern, accessible way for customers to view his work, request custom quotes, and engage with the brand. It serves as a testament to both his skill and my dedication to helping his business thrive in the digital age.
